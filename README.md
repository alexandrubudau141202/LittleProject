An intro to Multithreading(I loved this chapter about java multithreading)

This project, has been assigned to me from a course I followed during the whole academic year 2022-2023, up until the 16.09.2023.

As we were going up the ladder, about some useful Java arguments, we got "stuck" in the Threads' chapter, which I loved.

The exercise wants the programmer, such as me :)), to implement a car's control unit. 

Formerly, we just had to implement the thread class, to make it possible for us to turn on the Ac, and turn it off.

I decided instead to go BIG, and to implement a whole infotainment system. 

So this is my code, feel free to use it, and play with it.
